# Git, GitHub Workshop

## Terminology

##### *Repository (repo)*
Simply put, this is your project folder. This repository can be located locally (in your file system on your computer), or remotely (on Github). Either way, it is the same repository.

##### *Version Control*
We will use Git for this. A way of keeping track of changes in the code which makes it possible to work with multiple developers on the same repo.

##### *Git*
A version control system.

##### *Github*
A remote location where you can store you code, and which all the members of the team have access to. Think of it like a dropbox or google docs for code. One of the big differences however is most repositories on github are public. Anybody can see your code.

##### *Commit*
A way of saving your code at different points along the project. Unlike many tools you may have used however, all commits are saved. This creates a project history and a way to track changes.

##### *Branches*
As you work on a git repo the first branch you are on is usually the default branch. This is often called `master`. If you start working on a section of the website (say the footer styling), it is best practise to create your own branch for that feature. Creating your own branch is like taking a copy of `master` and renaming it. When you commit, they will now be on that new branch only.
